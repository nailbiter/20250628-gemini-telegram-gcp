Of course. Here is the refactored advice, with all project-specific names removed and replaced with an environment variable for safe public use.

To store fewer images and reduce your storage costs, you should set up a **Cloud Storage Lifecycle Management policy** on the bucket where your images are stored. This policy automatically deletes old, unused images for you.

## A Safe Lifecycle Rule

The best approach is to create a rule that deletes images only when they are old, no longer in use, and have been superseded by newer versions. This prevents you from accidentally deleting an image that a live Cloud Run service depends on.

Hereâ€™s how to implement this "set-it-and-forget-it" solution.

### 1\. Create a `lifecycle.json` File

Create a file named `lifecycle.json` in your project's root directory. This file defines a rule with three conditions that must all be met for an image to be deleted.

```json
{
  "rule": [
    {
      "action": {
        "type": "Delete"
      },
      "condition": {
        "isLive": false,
        "age": 60,
        "numNewerVersions": 5
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

This rule translates to: "Delete an image only if **ALL** of these are true:"

  * It is **not** currently being used by any active Cloud Run service (`"isLive": false`).
  * It is older than 60 days (`"age": 60`).
  * There are at least 5 newer versions of the image in the registry (`"numNewerVersions": 5`).

### 2\. Apply the Rule to Your Bucket

Run the following `gcloud` command to apply this policy to the GCS bucket that Artifact Registry uses. The name of this bucket is based on your project ID, which can be referenced using an environment variable.

Make sure your `$GCLOUD_PROJECT` environment variable is set to your Project ID before running this command.

```bash
gcloud storage buckets update gs://artifacts.$GCLOUD_PROJECT.appspot.com --lifecycle-file=lifecycle.json
```

Once you run this command, the lifecycle policy is active. Google Cloud will now automatically manage and delete your old container images in the background, ensuring your storage costs remain low without any further manual intervention.
