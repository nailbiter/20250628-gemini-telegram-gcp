Of course. Here is the final, optimized `Dockerfile` using the recommended distroless strategy.

This version incorporates all the best practices we've discussed: it uses a multi-stage build, installs `git` only in the temporary builder stage, and results in a minimal, secure final image.

-----

## \#\# Final `Dockerfile`

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile

# ==============================================================================
# Stage 1: The "Builder" Stage
# This stage has all the tools needed to build the application (like git).
# ==============================================================================
FROM python:3.9-slim as builder

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Install git, which is required by pip to install your custom toolbox from GitHub.
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends git

# Install Python dependencies into a separate "wheels" directory.
# This pre-compiles them for easy copying to the next stage.
COPY requirements.txt ./
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade pip
RUN pip wheel --no-cache-dir --wheel-dir /usr/src/app/wheels -r requirements.txt


# ==============================================================================
# Stage 2: The Final "Runtime" Stage
# This stage uses a minimal "distroless" image from Google. It contains
# only Python and our application, making it small and secure.
# It does NOT contain a shell, a package manager, or git.
# ==============================================================================
FROM gcr.io/distroless/python3-debian11

WORKDIR /app

# Copy the pre-built Python packages from the builder stage.
COPY --from=builder /usr/src/app/wheels /wheels

# Copy all your application source code (e.g., *.py files).
# It's recommended to use a .dockerignore file to exclude unnecessary files.
COPY . .

# Tell the Python interpreter where to find the installed packages.
ENV PYTHONPATH=/wheels

# The default command to run the application.
# This can be overridden by the --command flag during 'gcloud run deploy'.
# Example for a FastAPI app:
CMD ["gunicorn", "-k", "uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8080", "time_react:app"]
